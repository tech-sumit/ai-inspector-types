# ai-inspector-types Rules

- This is a TYPES-ONLY package. NEVER add runtime dependencies.
- All exports MUST use `export type` or `export interface`.
- Types align with the WebMCP specification (navigator.modelContext / modelContextTesting).
- DiscoveredTool.inputSchema is always a DOMString (JSON-stringified string), NOT a parsed object.
- ToolSource.callTool() takes string inputArguments and returns Promise<string | null>.
- InspectorEvent is a discriminated union — always switch on the `type` field.
- Protocol messages are directional — name types by source->destination direction.
